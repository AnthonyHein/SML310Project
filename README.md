# Using Meteorological Data Towards Horse Racing Prediction

This repository contains all work performed as part of my final project for _SML310: Research Projects in Data Science_.

At the top level, you can find two important files which summarize my work:

- `SML_310_Anthony_Hein_Final_Project.pdf`: This is my writeup detailing all steps taken throughout the data science lifecycle.
- `SML_310_Anthony_Hein_Final_Presentation.pdf`: This is my presentation which succinctly goes over my work at a higher level.

Also, note that there is an accompanying web application for this project at [http://horseracing.anthonyhein.com](http://horseracing.anthonyhein.com) where
a user can play around with a model similar to that used in the paper right in the browser.

For data files, trained models, or further instructions on how to reproduce these results, contact the author.
